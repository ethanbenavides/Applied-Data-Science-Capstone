# Applied Data Science Capstone

This project is my capstone project for the IBM Professional Data Science Certification. In this project, I collected data on SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches, and I determined which features contribute to a prediction algorithm used to see if a Falcon 9 rocket launch can have its booster recovered for re-use.

 ## Part 1: Data Collection and Cleaning
 - Collecting, wrangling, and cleaning data from the SpaceX REST API can be found [here](https://github.com/ethanbenavides/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/71f960302d459c9f0cef7705edcd0fd8092f97c7/Data%20Collection%20-%20REST%20API.ipynb).
 - Web scraping can be found [here](https://github.com/ethanbenavides/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/71f960302d459c9f0cef7705edcd0fd8092f97c7/Data%20Collection%20-%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb).

## Part 2: Exploratory Analysis and Understanding
- SQL queries:

# Applied Data Science Capstone

This project is my capstone project for the IBM Professional Data Science Certification. In this project, I collected data on SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches, and I determined which features contribute to a prediction algorithm used to see if a Falcon 9 rocket launch can have its booster recovered for re-use.

Here is some context for the project:

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage of a rocket launch.
Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
